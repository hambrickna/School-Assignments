# School-Assignments
A general collection of some programming assignments I have completed during my time at S&amp;T.

Currently contains two assignments that focus on the method of evolutionary computing:

The first assignment mutates and reproduces different random strings in order to evolve a string that is as close 
as possible to the inputed user string.

The second assignment uses a fitness function to measure the fitness of a given keyboard layout to evolve and produce a keyboard
with as few space between keystrokes as possible trained on a corpus of text.
